# Overview

I created this software to practice implementing JavaScript alongside HTML and CSS. In this software, I established a foundation to build a currency exchange by using JavaScript for multiplication. Subsequently, I wanted to practice implementing recursion, so I created a factorial calculator. Finally, I aimed to practice using native array ES6 functions, so I worked on mapping, filtering, and reducing arrays. Overall, my purpose was to practice using JavaScript and to test what I have learned so far with JavaScript.

# Development Environment

*Visual Studio Code *Git/Github *Css 3 *HTMl 5 *JavaScript *JQuerey 1.12.4.min - Library for JavaScript

# Useful Websites

- [JQuery used to download libaray and find information on how to use the library](https://jquery.com/)
- [W3Schools used to learn the basics of JavaScript ](https://www.w3schools.com/js)

# Future Work

- I would like to expand on the currency exchange part and need to find a free library that can pull live rates.
- I could definitely improve the colors of the website. I would like to change the background and font colors.
- I would like to improve the spacing of the different parts of the website and alignment.
